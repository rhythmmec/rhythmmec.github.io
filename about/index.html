			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I am currently a third year student at San Diego State University, pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. This past summer I interned as a Software Developer at Sharp Healthcare. Currently, I am working as a Teaching Assistant in Data Structures at San Diego State University, and as a Research Assistant in Edwards Labs. When I’m not coding, I like to read and explore sunny San Diego.</p>
