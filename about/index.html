			<p>I am a recent graduate in Computer Science. I'm currently interning at Nortek Security & Control. Previously I have interned as a Software Developer at Sharp Healthcare, worked as a Teaching Assistant in Data Structures, and as a Research Assistant at Edwards Labs. When Iâ€™m not coding, I like to read and explore sunny San Diego.</p>
